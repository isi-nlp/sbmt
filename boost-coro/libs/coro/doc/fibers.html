and finally show how Boost.Coroutine can be implemented in term of
fibers.</p>

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="files/caution.png"></span><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> compliance does not guarantee the presence of

<a name="id2630352"></a>The APIs</h4>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> in practice implements pure symmetric coroutines. While
argument passing from coroutine to coroutine is not explicitly
supported, it can be implemented easily on top of the existing
facilities.</p>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> is extremely similar as it supports
argument-less symmetric coroutine switching.</p>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code> function is used to yield from the current fiber
to a new one. Notice that it requires that a fiber is already
running. The current context is saved in the current fiber.</p>
<div class="informaltable"><table class="table">
<colgroup><col></colgroup>
<tbody><tr><td class="blurb">
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="files/note.png"></span><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code> also provides <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiberEx</span></code> that can
optionally save the floating point context. The Microsoft
documentation warns that if the appropriate flag is not set the
floating point context may not be saved and restored correctly. In
practice this seems not to be needed because the calling conventions
on this platform requires the floating point register stack to be empty before calling any
function, <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code> included. The exception is that if the
floating point control word is modified, other fibers will see the new
floating point status. This should be expected thought, because the
control word should be treated as any other shared
state. Currently Boost.Coroutine does 
not set the "save floating point" flag (saving the floating
point control word is a very expensive operation), but seems to work
fine anyway. To complicate the matter more, recent <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code>
documentation reveal that the  <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">FIBER_FLAG_FLOAT_SWITCH</span></code> flag is no
longer supported since Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP4.</td></tr></tbody>

<p>
The corresponding function in the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> standard is <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></code> that
saves the current context in a memory area pointed by the first
argument and restores the context pointed by the second argument. This
function is more flexible than <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code> because it has no
concept of current fiber. Unfortunately it is also deeply flawed
because the standard requires
requires the signal mask to be saved and restored. This in turn
requires a function call. Because of this, at least on Linux,
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></code> is about a thousand times slower than an hand rolled
context switch. <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code> has no such a problem and is close to
optimal.</p>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> requires a context to be created with a call to
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">CreateFiber</span></code>. The stack size, the address of the function that
will be run on the new fiber, and a void pointer to pass to this
function must be provided. This function is simple 
to use but the user cannot provide its own stack pointer (useful if a
custom allocator is used). The function will return a pointer to the
initialized fiber.</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> has <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span></code>, that takes as parameter a context previously
initialized, a function pointer to bind to the context and a void
pointer to be passed to the function. The function is a bit more
awkward to use because the context to be initialized by a call to
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">getcontext</span></code> and some fields (specifically the stack pointer and stack
size) to be manually initialized. On the other hand the user can
specify the area that will be used as a stack.</p>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> provides a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">DeleteFiber</span></code> function that must be called
to delete a fiber. <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> has no such facility, because contexts are
not internally heap allocated and require no special cleanup. The user
is responsible of freeing the stack area when no longer necessary.</p>
<a name="convert_thread_to_fiber"></a><p></p>
<p>
A quirk of the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> is the requirement that the current thread
be converted to fiber before calling <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code>. (<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> doesn't
require this because <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></code> will initialize automatically the
context that it is saving to). A thread is converted with a call to
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></code>. When the fiber is not longer needed a call to
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertFiberToThread</span></code> must be performed (It is not required that the
fiber to be converted to thread was the original one) or fibrous
resources are leaked. Calling <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></code>more than once
will also leak resources. Unfortunately the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code> does not include a
function to detect if a thread has been already converted. This makes
hard for different libraries to cooperate. In practice it is
possible, although undocumented, to detect if a thread has been
converted, and Boost.Coroutine does so. <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Longhorn</span></code> will provide an
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></code> function that can be used for this purpose.</p>
<div class="informaltable"><table class="table">
<colgroup><col></colgroup>
<tbody><tr><td class="blurb">
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="files/note.png"></span> For the sake of information we document here how
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></code> can be implemented. If a thread has not been converted, <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">GetCurrentFiber</span></code> will
return null on some systems (this appears to be
the case on <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Windows95</span></code> derived OSs), or 0x1E00 on others (this
appears to be the case on NT derived systems; after a thread has been
converted and reconverted it may then return null). What the magic
number 0x1E00 means can only be guessed, it is probably related to the
alternate meaning of the fiber pointer field in the Thread
Identification Block. This field in fact is also marked as
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">TIB</span><span class="identifier"> Verion</span></code>. What version is meant is not documented. This is
probably related to compatibility to the common ancestor of <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">NT</span></code> and
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">OS</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="number">2</span></code> where this field is also identified with this name. While this
magic number is not guaranteed to stay fixed in 
future system (although unlikely to change as the OS vendor is very
concerned about backward compatibility), this is not a problem as
future <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code> OSs will have a native <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></code> functions.</td></tr></tbody>

<a name="fibers.the_environments"></a><h4>
<a name="id2630906"></a>The environments</h4>
<p><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code> explicitly guarantees that contexts will be swapped correctly
with fibers, especially exception handlers. Exceptions, in the form of
Structured Exception Handling, are a documented area of the operating
system, and in practice most programming language on this environment
use <span class="bold"><strong>SEH</strong></span> for exception handling. Fibers guarantee that exceptions
will work correctly.</p>
<p>
The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> has no concept of exceptions, thus there is no guarantee
that they are automatically handled by <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span>&nbsp;</code> (and
in fact on many systems they not work correctly). In practice systems
that use fame unwind tables for exception handling (the so-called no
overhead exception handling) should be safe, while
systems that use a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">setjmp</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></code> based system will not without
some compiler specific help.</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></code> guarantees that a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span></code> can be saved in one thread and
restored on another, as long as fiber local storage is used instead of
thread local storage. Unfortunately most third party libraries use
only thread local storage. The standard C library should be safe
though.</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> does not specify the behavior of contexts in conjunction with
threads, and in practice complier optimizations often prevent contexts
to be migrated between threads.</p>
<a name="fibers.the_implementation"></a><h4>
<a name="id2631034"></a>The implementation</h4>
<p>
Boost.Coroutine can be straightforwardly implemented with the
<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code>. These functions can be directly mapped
to <code class="computeroutput"><a href="">yield_to</a><span class="special">()</span></code>, while a transformation similar to the one
described <a href="symmetric_coroutines.html#symmetric_transformation">here</a> is used to implement
asymmetric functionality.</p>
<p>
It is more interesting to analyze the implementation of
Boost.Coroutine on top <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fibers</span></code>.</p>
<p>
When a coroutine is created a new <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span></code> is associated with it. This
fiber is deleted when the coroutine is destroyed. Yielding form
coroutine to coroutine is done straight forwardly using <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></code>.</p>
<a name="convert_thread_to_fiber_optimization"></a><p></p>
<p>
Switching from the main context to a coroutine is a bit more
involved. Boost.Coroutine does not require the main context to be a
coroutine, thus <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></code>is only called lazily when a
coroutine call need to be performed and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertFiberToThread</span></code> is
called immediately after the coroutine yields to the main
context. This implies a huge performance penalty, but correctness has
been preferred above performance. If the thread has been already
converted by the user, the calls to the two functions above are
skipped and there is no penalty. Thus performance
sensitive programs should always call <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></code>
explicitly for every thread that may use coroutines.</p>
<a name="fibers.conclusions"></a><h4>
<a name="id2631181"></a>Conclusions</h4>
<p>
Of the two <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">APIs</span></code>, the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> one is simpler to use and more flexible
from a programmer point of view, but in practice it is not very useful
because it is often very slow and there are no guarantees that it will
work correctly on all circumstances.</p>
<p>
On the other hand the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> is a bit more complex, and matches
less with the spirit of Boost.Coroutine, but the detailed description
of the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">API</span></code>, the guarantee that the operating system supports it and
the support for migration, make it the most solid implementation of
coroutines available.</p>
<p>
Finally, while <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span></code> and family are considered obsolescent
since the last <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></code> edition, the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span><span class="identifier"> API</span></code> is here to stay,
especially because it seems that the new <code class="computeroutput"><span class="special">.</span><span class="identifier">NET</span></code> environment makes use
of it.</p>
